p Front-end Development: I am familiar with MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node) and have professionally made web components using HTML templating languages like Handlebars and Polymer Web Components. Since school, Iâ€™ve been pursuing learning new languages and frameworks on my own, including Angular2, Sass and Jade.
p Back-end Development: I've also worked with SQL server in creating and managing databases both professionally and while in school. 
p Communication Skills: I prefer work environments that are more collaborative. During my second internship, I had the opportunity to work with UX designers and UI developers in an Agile Development environment, acting as a middleman between our designers and developers. Being one of the few people who knew the framework, I introduced several co-workers (UX, interns, and new hires) to several core aspects of the framework, such as routing, linked data and databinding.
